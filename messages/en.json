    "altec": "A modern take on the legendary Altec 816 bass horn, originally used in classic Voice of the Theatre systems. The design was modified with a split, symmetrical bass reflex port and built from 18 mm and 15 mm birch plywood, reinforced internally for maximum rigidity and resonance control. The cabinets were delivered prepped and ready for the client’s own finishing.",
    "m1": "This time, we present compact bookshelf speakers, developed through a complete process – from 3D design to the finished set. The enclosures, made from 16 mm MDF with a double front panel and reinforced interior, provide excellent rigidity and vibration control. Finished in Midnight Sky lacquer, the speakers impress not only with their appearance but also with their sound – natural, spacious, and precise.",
    "ls3": "A double project for a single client – compact KEF CS1A speakers and a DIY Rogers AB1 subwoofer, crafted from 12 mm birch plywood and 16 mm MDF. Each enclosure is meticulously detailed according to the design and renders, ensuring perfect proportions and aesthetics. The result is a set with a iconic look and exceptional sound.",
    "jaspa": "The client had clear expectations – he wanted new speakers that would deliver fuller vocals compared to his Pylon Jasper. Keeping the preferred enclosure shape and familiar drivers, we designed an MTM (midwoofer-tweeter-midwoofer) configuration tailored to his needs. The tweeter’s placement perfectly aligned with ear height on his sofa, confirming the concept’s effectiveness and improved sound.",
    "klipsch": "Klipsch RF7 mk3 – the client sent the original drivers and requested a faithfully reproduced enclosure in glossy black with a plinth. The final result impresses with flawless lacquer and meticulously crafted details. These powerful speakers make a huge impact in person."
